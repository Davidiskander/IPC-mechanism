# IPC-mechanism
Implementation to a primitive mechanism/capability for two UNIX processes on the same host to communicate through the UNIX file system. This mechanism is similar to what is known as UNIX pipes. The purpose of this project is to deal with synchronization issues and exercise your skills in UNIX programming rather than developing a new usable IPC mechanism.
